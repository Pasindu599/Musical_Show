Here, I used all oop concepts.


two types of performances: live performances and studio performances

live performances :  the artist can interact with the audience
			can be recorded


Only studio performances have the function of audio processing
can be recorded

but the recording methods are different for the two types




When a performance is initiated
Welcome to the Performance [name of the performance] by [name of the main artist]!
The main artist sings
Backup singers and backup dancers back him/her up.


Each performance :  main artist, performance name, year, venue, track list, backup singers, and backup dancers

The track list consists of a variable number of music tracks
Anyone can make changes to the track list
the currently existing track list should not be visible to outsiders

The venue and year attributes can be viewed by anyone(PRIVATE), but they can not be changed.(ONLY GETTER)

Performance name is both viewable and changeable.

The number of backup singers and backup dancers varies for each performance.



Main artist, backup singers, and backup dancers are all considered as artists
Backup dancers can dance.

This is the method [name of the method] in the class [name of the class].

Both main artist and backup singers are considered as singers
All singers can sing
